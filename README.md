## Overview

This repository contains my project submission for the Machine Learning and Statistics module for 2021. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that I have achieved the learning outcomes of the module, which are:
- Describe the stochastic nature of real-world measurements.
- Select an appropriate mathematical model of a real-world problem.
- Select an appropriate cost function for a given machine learning task.
- Apply an optimisation technique to the parameters of a model.

## Table of Contents

The reposiory contain 2 jupyter notebook. One notebook that provides an overview of Scikit-Learn and a look at 2 machine learning modules within it and  a second notebook that discusses the SciPy library.

## How to Run Jupyter Lab

- nedd to list dependancies 

To run this jupyter notebook file you will need to install Python, ideally through th Anaconda distribution. Then you will need to download this repository to your local device. To open the jupyter notebook from your device, please navigate to the folder containing the notebook in your your command line interface and then type:

`jupyter notebook`

1. Download[Anaconda]().
2. Download[cmder]() if on Windows.
3. 'jupyter lab'.

## Credits

I have borrowed from the Machine Learning and Statistic course work for this project. I also heavily replied upon the Scikit-Learn and SciPy documentation throughout.
