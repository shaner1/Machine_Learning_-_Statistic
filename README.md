## Overview

This repository contains my project submission for the Machine Learning and Statistics module for 2021. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that I have achieved the learning outcomes of the module, which are:
- Describe the stochastic nature of real-world measurements.
- Select an appropriate mathematical model of a real-world problem.
- Select an appropriate cost function for a given machine learning task.
- Apply an optimisation technique to the parameters of a model.

The reposiory consists of two separate jupyter notebooks. The first notebook deals with Scikit-Learn and includes an overview of Scikit-Learn and a comparison of three difference machine learning modules within it; linear, ridge and lasso. The second notebook focuses on the SciPy library in which I performing a one-way ANOVA test using SciPy and investigate the assumptions associated with this test.

## How to Run Jupyter Lab

To run my project submission you will need a python environment and packages and dependancies are listed in my requirements.txt file. The key files are the ipynb files Scikit-Learn ipynb andSciPy ipynb, which are jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks is an interactive python web environment that runs on your local machine. 

the top of the notebook should explain what they are and wha to do with it
 
 start them Jupiter lab.

- nedd to list dependancies 

To run these jupyter notebooks you will need to install Python, ideally through th Anaconda distribution. Then you will need to download this repository to your local device. To open the jupyter notebook from your device, please navigate to the folder containing the notebooks using the `cd` command + the file path in your your command line interface and then type `jupyter notebook` + notebook name. For example, on my device the notebooks, the ipynb files, are contained within a folder called Machine Learning & Statistics in my documents folder. To navigate to them I shall type into the command line the following: `cd/Documents/GMIT/Machine Learning & Statistics` and then `jupyter notebook scikit-learn ipynb` to open 




1. Download[Anaconda]().
2. Download[cmder]() if on Windows.
3. 'jupyter lab'.

## Explore

If you wish try some for other machine learning modules on the dataset you can simple do so by searching for model in the Scikit-learn documentation adding replacing the following code 

```python
import 
```

## Credits

Thoughout this project, I have borrowed heavily from the Machine Learning and Statistic module course work belonging to Dr.Ian McLoughlin of GMIt. I also replied upon the Scikit-Learn and SciPy documentation. For help with markdown, I have referenced this blog https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I am happy with how my submission has turned out, but there are a few aspect I would like to improve upon. For the Scikit-learn notebook, I wanted to use neural networks, but wasnt able to find a suitable dataset for what I hoped to achieve. I invested a lot of time in trying to understand neural networks and seraching for appropriate datasets. This was not time wasted as I learnt a lot, but it is time spent that I could have use to better understand the theorical aspect of regression analysis. For the my SciPy notebook, I would also improve my explanation of the theory behind ANOVA and hypothesis testing in general. I would also have liked to include post hoc tests.
